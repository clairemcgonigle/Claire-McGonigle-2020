# Claire-McGonigle-2020

Claire McGonigle's personal website, designed and built using HTML and CSS during Spring 2020.

Building this website was my first venture into web development.  I had no previous experience with HTML or CSS, and was able to learn both over the course of this project.  I originally built all of the website elements myself, but soon realized that they weren't optimized for smaller screens as they didn't automatically resize.  I then learned about Bootstrap, and updated my page with their frameworks for automatic resizing optimization.
